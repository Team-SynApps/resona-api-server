# Resona API Server(SNS)
> A scalable SNS API server built with Spring Boot and Oracle Cloud, supporting feeds, comments, and member management.

This server is divided into two main domains. Member and Social Media.

The Member domain is responsible for member registration and login, account status, and managing member profiles.

The Social Media domain handles feed uploads, comments, replies, and other interactions on the platform.

## üìö API Documentation

The project uses **Swagger** for documenting REST APIs.

> API docs (Swagger UI) are available in the production environment and accessible to authorized users only.  
> For internal use during development and testing.

## üìÅ File Upload

This project uses **OCI Object Storage (oci-bucket)** for file uploads, using **Oracle Java SDK v3.43.1**.

### ‚úÖ Upload Flow

1. Upload file to **buffer bucket** (`PutObjectRequest`)
2. On confirmation, copy file to **disk bucket** (`CopyObjectRequest`)
3. Extract and return file metadata (name, size, content type, dimensions, etc.)

## ü™µ Logging

This project uses **Logback** for logging, which is the default logging framework in Spring Boot. Logs are sent to the console and **Fluentd** for aggregation, which then forwards them to **MongoDB**.

We recommend using the **SLF4J API** for logging, which allows for flexible integration with different logging frameworks.

### ‚úÖ How to Use
```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class ExampleClass {
    private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ExampleClass.class);

    private void loggingExample() {
        logger.info("Log example");
    }
}
```

### üßæ Logging Destinations

- `Console`: for local development (`dev`, `docker` profiles)
- `Fluentd`: logs are sent to a Fluentd agent in the `release` profile, which then forwards them to MongoDB.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Logback is configured in [`resources/logback-spring.xml`](./src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml).  
Here is a snippet of how Fluentd is integrated.

```xml
<appender name="FLUENT" class="ch.qos.logback.more.appenders.FluencyLogbackAppender">
  <tag>springboot.${HOSTNAME}</tag>
  <remoteHost>${FLUENTD_HOST}</remoteHost>
  <port>24224</port>
  <maxWaitSeconds>3</maxWaitSeconds>

  <encoder class="ch.qos.logback.classic.encoder.PatternLayoutEncoder">
    <pattern>${LOG_PATTERN}</pattern>
  </encoder>
</appender>
```

- The Fluentd appender sends logs to a Fluentd agent, which is responsible for forwarding them to other services like MongoDB.
- The Fluentd host is configured via the `FLUENTD_HOST` environment variable.

## üö® Error Handling

This project uses a centralized error handling strategy based on `@RestControllerAdvice` and Spring Security hooks.  
All exceptions are converted into a consistent JSON response with detailed metadata.

### ‚úÖ Features
- Consistent error response structure with status, message, path, server info, and request ID
- Custom error codes for domain-specific exceptions
- Handles:
  - Business exceptions (`BaseException`)
  - Validation errors (`MethodArgumentNotValidException`)
  - Authentication errors (`AuthenticationEntryPoint`)
  - Authorization errors (`AccessDeniedHandler`)
  - Unexpected internal exceptions

### üí• Example Error Response

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "status": 404,
    "message": "Feed not found",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-03 14:22:01",
    "path": "/api/feed/100",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "serverName": "resona-api",
    "requestId": "5a1f56b4-e2e9-490c-8c30-abcde1234567",
    "errorCode": "FEED001"
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "error": "Feed not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

> Error response metadata is built using `ErrorMetaDataDto`, and every exception includes a unique `requestId` to help trace issues.

## Test
This project follows a layered architecture and adopts a strategic approach to writing test cases.

### Essential Layers to Test
- **Service Layer**: Business logic is crucial, so it must be tested.
- **Repository Layer**: If complex queries exist, they should be tested.
- **Controller Layer**: If APIs are exposed, they should be tested.

### Optional Layers to Test
- **Entity Layer**: Test only if domain logic is included.
- **Basic CRUD Repository**: Spring Data JPA ensures basic CRUD operations, so explicit tests are optional.

Test cases are written based on these principles to ensure efficiency and maintainability.
